# Markdown To Spanned
=====================

Conversion of Markdown to Android Styled Text (Spanned Text) that can be used in Android Views that support them (TextView, EditText, Button, etc).

Supports almost\* all markdown tags from [John Gruber's Markdown Spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and more\*\*.

\* (atm) expect for images, codeblocks, and horizontal ruler

\*\* strikeout and newlines in a paragraph content treated as real line breaks

``` java
// Convert the passed Markdown String into styled Android CharSequence
textView.setText(Markdown.fromMarkdown("This is **markdown**!"));
```



## Features
===========
 * Use ´Markdown.fromMarkdown()´ just as you would use ´Html.fromHtml()´ to set styled texts on your views.

 ** TODO insert pic of example **

## Planned Features
===================

 * Load content of images from urls, assets, drawables, etc.
 * Handling of horizontal ruler
 * Configuration of style classes
 * Proper newline handling in code blocks
